## Services  
**Spyregia – Safety & Cybersecurity for Embedded Systems**  
We secure what runs your world.  

At Spyregia, we bring safety and security to life inside embedded systems.  
Our work bridges deep firmware engineering with practical safety and cybersecurity expertise — from first concept to field deployment.  

---

### 1. Embedded Safety & Cybersecurity Audits  
Your system under the microscope.  
We analyze existing firmware and architectures for safety and security gaps — fast, precise, and hands-on.  

- Vulnerability & threat assessment  
- Code & architecture review  
- Compliance mapping (IEC 62443, NIST CSF, ISO 26262, FDA)  
- Actionable findings with clear mitigation paths  

💡 *Free if no issues found – pay only when we detect real risks.*  

---

### 2. Firmware Development & Modernization  
From clean-sheet design to life extension.  
We develop, port, and harden firmware for safety-critical applications.  

- Embedded software design in C, C++, and Rust  
- Migration of legacy systems to Rust for memory safety  
- Bootloader and OTA update frameworks  
- Secure Boot, authentication, and cryptography integration  

---

### 3. Security Architecture & Concept Design  
Security starts with structure.  
We help you design systems that are secure by design — not by accident.  

- Threat modeling and risk analysis  
- Secure development lifecycle (SDLC)  
- NIST CSF 2.0 and IEC 62443 alignment  
- FDA Cybersecurity Guideline support  

Our focus: practical security that fits your product, not paperwork.  

---

### 4. Functional Safety Consulting  
We make standards usable.  
Support for ISO 26262 (Automotive) and IEC 62304 (Medical) without the bureaucracy overload.  

- Safety case review and documentation  
- Traceability and verification planning  
- Risk and hazard analysis  
- Tailored processes for small and mid-sized teams  

---

### 5. Secure OTA & Lifecycle Solutions  
Long-term reliability meets modern update strategies.  

- Robust OTA architecture and bootloaders  
- Delta and rollback management  
- Cryptographic signing and key handling  
- Lifecycle support from prototype to production  

Because products evolve — safety must follow.  

---

### 6. Training & Knowledge Transfer  
We build teams that build securely.  

- Rust for Embedded Safety  
- Cybersecurity for Firmware Engineers  
- IEC 62443 / NIST CSF fundamentals  
- Secure coding mindset and review practice  

Hands-on workshops, no slideshows.

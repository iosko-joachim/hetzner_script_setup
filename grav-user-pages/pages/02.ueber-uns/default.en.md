## About Spyregia  
**We build trust into technology.**

Spyregia was founded to unite *embedded safety* and *cybersecurity* — not as checkboxes, but as engineering disciplines.  
We design firmware that stays reliable when it matters most: in medical devices, industrial controllers, and connected products worldwide.  

---

### Our Background
For over 20 years, we’ve been developing embedded software in fields where failure isn’t an option.  
From pacemakers to production lines, we’ve seen how real-world constraints shape great engineering:
- Tight deadlines  
- Zero tolerance for defects  
- Every bit must have a reason 

---

### What We’re Good At
- **Firmware Development:** C/C++, Rust  
- **RTOS Expertise:** FreeRTOS, bare-metal architectures  
- **Communication:** BLE, CAN, SPI, I²C, UART, USB  
- **Security:** Encryption, secure boot, authentication, OTA integrity  
- **Safety:** IEC 62304 and ISO 26262, applied with pragmatism

### How We Work
We believe in traceable, testable, and teachable engineering.  
Every project starts with a clear threat model and ends with measurable robustness.  
We document what we do to make results reproducible.

Our values: **quality, transparency, efficiency.**  
Our style: **structured where it matters, flexible where it helps.**.

### Why Spyregia
Because real security isn’t a feature — it’s a foundation.  
And we know how to build it.
